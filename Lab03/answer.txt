2.1. I prefer addDigitalVideoDisc(DigitalVideoDisc [] dvdList) as we do not have to using method overloading many times.

3. Java is a pass by value programming language.
- swap method
In the swap method, the two parameters o1 and o2 are local variables that hold copies of the references to jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD, respectively. 
The swap method swaps the values of these local variables, but it does not affect the references held by the original variables jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD in the main method.
- changeTitle method
In the changeTitle method, the parameter dvd holds a copy of the reference to the DigitalVideoDisc object that jungleDVD references. 
The method then sets the title field of that object to the value of the title parameter passed in. 
Therefore, the title field of the DigitalVideoDisc object referenced by jungleDVD is updated to the value of cinderellaDVD's title.
The subsequent line dvd = new DigitalVideoDisc(oldTitle); creates a new DigitalVideoDisc object with the old title of dvd, 
but this new object is assigned to the local variable dvd, which does not affect the reference held by the original jungleDVD variable in the main method. 
Therefore, the original DigitalVideoDisc object that jungleDVD references still has its title updated to the value of cinderellaDVD's title.

6. The return type of the toString() method should be String.
