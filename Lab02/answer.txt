No, Java does not allow you to create two constructors with the same number and types of parameters in the same class. 
In the scenario you described, if you create a constructor to build a DVD by title that takes a single String parameter, 
and then create another constructor to build a DVD by category that also takes a single String parameter, you would get a compilation error.
